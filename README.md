Create, edit, move, and delete stickies!

## What Worked Well
- Hooking it up to Firebase went a lot smoother than I anticipated!
- Had a lot of fun styling it!

## What Didn't
- Getting started was really difficult as I didn't quite know how to dive into React on my own.
- Ran into a bug that messed up indexing. After multiple hours, turned out that I just needed a key param for my notes :(

## Extra Credit
- Change color of sticky notes using colored circles (updates for other users too)
- Show other users editing note
- Styling things: background gif, hovers, dropshadows, etc.
